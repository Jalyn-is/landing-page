# landing-page
Hey guys, Jalyn here. The landing page was hard for me but id feel like i did my best. It didnt't turn out the way i wanted it to but i hope i'll be able to revist it and edit it how i want to. I defintely will give java script my all and i won't flunk it.

##Mistakes
Okay so the mistake i think i made in the landing page was using a wrapper selector and using display flex on that the maargin auto. That ruined my chance to effectively use the backgroun-color as what was presented in the project. The overall result was good though and everything else was accurate. I'll keep learning  and puhing myself and i hope that you the reader will keep doing the same. Peace!
